# quantum-rotor-codes

The repository contains relevant code for the paper C. Vuillot, A. Ciani, B. Terhal, "Homological Quantum Rotor Code: Logical Qubits from Torsion" (2023).

The notebooks to generate the data for Figure 8 and Figure 8 itself is located in the folder /fig_8_bacon_shor.  

# Software requirements

In order to run the notebook to generate the data for Figure 8 (fig_9_bacon_shor/bacon_shor_code_levels.ipynb)
it is necessary to install the package "pysqkit" for the study of superconducting circuits. 
The package is available at https://github.com/cianibegood/pysqkit.git, where instructions for the installation
can be found.
